The key findings from the data analysis are as follows:

    1.  For the client data :
        
           • Around 9.7% of clients have churned.
             
           • Numeric data is not Gaussian distributed, but somewhat right skewed.
             
           • Log transformation on numeric data gives a normal curve for most values, with a consolidation of values at 0.
             
           • There are a lot of outliers in the data.
             
           • There is some pattern in the year values, but no relationship between month and churn.
             
           • Only 18.2% of customers have subscribed to gas, with a higher churn rate among non-subscribers.
             
           • Some campaigns and sales channels have no fruitful results and should be discontinued.
       
       
    2.  For the price data :
              
           • There are lots of 0 peak prices and mid-peak prices, but very few 0 off-peak prices.
             
       • There is little difference in the average price values between churn and non-churn clients, suggesting that price is unlikely to be a significant factor in determining churn.
